# Week 4: Objects, Classes, `this`

## Objects

An object is a collection of related data and/or functionality (which usually consists of several variables and functions — which are called properties and methods when they are inside objects.) The data we store in an object is not ordered — we can only access it by calling its associated key. You can create an object with key-value pairs using the following syntax:
```javascript
var person = {
  name: ['Bob', 'Smith'],
  age: 32,
  gender: 'male',
  interests: ['music', 'skiing'],
  bio: function() {
    return `${this.name[0]} ${this.name[1]} is ${this.age} years old. He likes ${this.interests[0]} and ${this.interests[1]}.`;
  },
  greeting: function() {
    return `Hi! I'm ${this.name[0]}.`;
  }
};
```

You can access object properties using *dot notation*. Below are some examples of how we can access properties on our `person` object:
```javascript
person.name[0]  // 'Bob'
person.age  // 32
person.interests[1]  // 'skiing'
person.bio()  // 'Bob Smith is 32 years years old. He likes music and skiing.'
person.greeting()  // 'Hi! I'm Bob.'
```

You can also access object properties using *bracket notation*. Here's how we would access the same properties as above, this time using bracket notation:
```javascript
person['name'][0]  // 'Bob'
person['age']  // 32
person['interests'][1]  // 'skiing'
person['bio']()  // 'Bob Smith is 32 years years old. He likes music and skiing.'
person['greeting']()  // 'Hi! I'm Bob.'
```
Dot notation has the advantage of concision. On the other hand, bracket notation is useful when you want to construct a property name dynamically:
```javascript
var introduction = function(inFirstPerson) {
  var prop = inFirstPerson ? 'greeting' : 'bio';
  return person[prop]();
}

console.log(introduction(true));  // 'Hi! I'm Bob.'
```

You can update object property values as well as add new ones:
```javascript
person.age = 29;
person['eyes'] = 'hazel';
person.farewell = function() { return 'Bye everybody!'; }
```
Accessing these properties then gives us:
```javascript
person.age  // 29
person.eyes  // 'hazel'
person.farewell()  // 'Bye everybody!'
```

JavaScript objects are like map data structures in Java or C++, with the restriction that the keys are strings. When accessing object properties, the property name is automatically converted to a string. As JavaScript arrays are objects, this applies to arrays as well. Thus, we observe the following behavior:
```
var a = [37, 47];
a['1'] = 53;
console.log(a[1]);  // 53
```

## Classes

A recent [specification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript) of JavaScript introduced a `class` syntax that looks and feels like classes in Java or C++. I only say "looks and feels" because JavaScript obeys a [different object model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain) from those languages. In fact, the JavaScript `class` syntax is merely [syntactic sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar) over its true object model. For our purposes in this course, however, we may assume that JavaScript classes behave in the same way as the classes with which we're already familiar.

Classes act as object templates. Let's look at a concrete example.
```javascript
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
    this.belly = [];
  }

  eat(food) {
    this.belly.push(food);
  }

  getName() {
    return this.name;
  }
}

// Dog is a subclass of Animal
class Dog extends Animal {
  constructor(name, breed) {
    // call the parent class constructor
    super(name);
    this.breed = breed;
  }

  bark() {
    console.log('Woof!');
  }
}
```
JavaScript `class` definitions look similar to how we define objects but with two main differences. First, every class definition requires a `constructor` method, which is called every time a new instance of the class is created. Second, there are no commas between methods in a class definition.

Once we've defined a class, we can create an object instance of it using the `new` operator.
```javascript
var a = new Animal('Abu');
var d = new Dog('Buddy', 'Golden Retriever');
```
These objects have access to the properties and methods defined in their associated class definitions.
```javascript
a.eat('banana');
console.log(a.name);  // 'Abu'
console.log(a.belly);  // ['banana']

d.eat('basketball');
console.log(d.name);  // 'Buddy'
console.log(d.belly);  // ['basketball']
d.bark();  // 'Woof!'
```

## `this`

Many JavaScript programmers get confused by what gets bound to the `this` keyword. Part of this is because `this` behaves differently in JavaScript than it does in other languages like Java or C++.

Let's consider how `this` works in Java.
```java
class Vehicle {
  int maxSpeed;

  public Vehicle(int maxSpeed) {
    this.maxSpeed = maxSpeed;
  }

  public int getMaxSpeed() {
    return this.maxSpeed;
  }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
  String make;

  public Car(int maxSpeed, String make) {
    super(maxSpeed);
    this.make = make;
  }

  public String getMake() {
    return this.make;
  }
}
```
In Java, we can always assume that `this` will be bound to an instance of the containing class or a subclass thereof. This is because Java methods are always associated with a calling object. For example, consider how we can invoke the method `getMaxSpeed` defined in the `Vehicle` class. We can call `v.getMaxSpeed()`, where `v` is an instance of `Vehicle` or `Car`, but we cannot invoke `getMaxSpeed()` (from outside of the class definition) without an object calling the method.

Things get more complicated in JavaScript, where functions are first-class objects. Unlike Java methods, which are always associated with some class definition, JavaScript functions can be passed around freely like numbers and booleans can. For example, returning to our `Animal`/`Dog` example from above, we can do the following:
```javascript
var d = new Dog('Snowball');
var bark = d.bark;
bark();  // 'Woof!'
```

We run into trouble, however, when we try to do the same thing with a method that has `this` in its definition:
```javascript
var a = new Animal('Joe');
var getName = a.getName;
getName();  // Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of undefined
```
The error message here is saying that, when running the `getName` function, `this` is bound to `undefined` rather than `a` as we might expect. 

To resolve this, we can explicitly [bind](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind) the value of `this` to the desired object:
```javascript
var a = new Animal('Joe');
var getName = a.getName.bind(a);
getName();  // 'Joe'
```

### **How to determine what is bound to `this`**

Now that we've seen how `this` can behave differently in JavaScript than we might expect, let's see how we can predict its behavior.

What is bound to `this` in a function body is determined by the function *call-site*: the location in the code where the function is called (**not where it's declared**). Once we have identified the function call-site, there are four rules we can use to determine what is bound to `this`.

1. If the function is called when instantiating a class using the `new` operator (i.e., the function is the `constructor` method of the class), then `this` is bound to the newly instantiated object.
    ```javascript
    class Foo {
      constructor() { this.bar = 'baz'; }
    }

    var foo = new Foo();  // <-- at this call-site, JavaScript runs the constructor function and binds `this` to the new object
    ```

2. If the function is an explicitly bound function, then `this` is bound to the specified object.
    ```javascript
    class Foo {
      constructor(bar) { this.bar = bar; }
      getBar() { return this.bar; }
    }

    var foo = new Foo('baz');
    var explicitlyBoundFunction = foo.getBar.bind({ bar: 'not baz'});
    console.log(explicitlyBoundFunction());  // 'not baz'
    ```

3. If the function is called as the method of an object, then `this` is bound to that object.
    ```javascript
    var foo = {
      bar: 'baz',
      getBar() { return this.bar; }
    }

    console.log(foo.getBar());  // 'baz'
    ```

4. Otherwise, `this` is `undefined`.

### **`this` in the context of arrow functions**

The four rules above apply to `this` in a regular function definition. JavaScript also comes with another class of functions called [*arrow functions*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions).
```javascript
var square = (x) => x * x;
console.log(square(4));  // 16
```
Arrow functions have their own rule for binding `this`. Whereas regular functions bind `this` according to their call-sites, arrow functions bind `this` according to their declarations. Specifically, they bind `this` to whatever is bound to `this` at the site of their declaration.
```javascript
var foo = {
  bar: 'baz',
  getRegularFunction() {
    return function() {
      return this.baz;
    }
  },
  getArrowFunction() {
    return () => this.baz;
  }
};

var regularFunction = foo.getRegularFunction();
var arrowFunction = foo.getArrowFunction();

console.log(regularFunction());  // undefined because none of the first three
                                 // rules for regular functions apply at this call-site

console.log(arrowFunction());  // 'baz' because foo.getArrowFunction() binds 
                               // `this` to `foo` in the method body of getArrowFunction
                               // and the returned arrow function binds `this` to
                               // whatever is `this` in its surrounding context
```
Arrow functions are often useful for fixing `this` in the definition of callback functions.
```javascript
var foo = {
  bar: 'baz',
  setUpEventHandler() {
    $('button').click(() => { console.log(this.bar); })
  }
}

foo.setUpEventHandler();
```
In the above program, the last line binds `this` in the body of `setUpEventHandler` to `foo`. By then passing an arrow function into the `click` method, we ensure that the value logged upon clicking a button is `'baz'`. If we had passed a regular function into the `click` method instead, it is not clear what value would be logged because it would depend on where exactly jQuery invokes the click handler in its internal implementation.
