## What is version control?

Version control describes a system that keeps track of changes to a code project over time. Each change to code is tracked so that if at any time, a developer wants to turn back time to a previous version of the code, he/she is able to do so. Every project that you start working on as a web developer benefits from being tracked in a version control system, because it will record the history of all the additions and changes that happen over time to the project. When working in a group, the version control system will also help to resolve conflicts when different team members make different changes to the same line of code.

---

## Git

Git is the most widely used version control system in the software development world today. It is an open source command line tool that tracks the entire history of changes in a project, called **commits**. It also provides a powerful branch management system (e.g., a developer branches off from the project master branch, develops a feature, then merges her changes back to the master branch), which makes it easier not only for the individual programmer to keep track of her various projects, but also for a group of programmers to manage and resolve any conflicts between their concurrent changes to a shared codebase. Many software projects, both commercial and open source, are version-controlled with Git and hosted on the web service [GitHub](https://www.github.com/).

In this course, we will use Git to manage all our projects. Each of you will maintain a Git **repository**--a project directory that stores and allows you to navigate your entire Git history--and host it on GitHub. Your repository will contain all your individual homework assignments for this course. Publishing all the changes to your code on GitHub as you work on it will ensure that if any issues happen with your computer, all the saved code is secured online and you can easily recover it.

To submit your homework, we will make use of **pull requests**. A pull request is a GitHub feature (strictly GitHub, not Git) that makes it easier for collaborators to review code changes before they are merged into the project's master branch. In our case, we will use pull requests to provide feedback on your homework. The next couple sections will provide more specific details.

## Create a GitHub account

If you don't have one already, register for an account on [GitHub.com](https://www.github.com/).

## Connect your computer to your GitHub account with SSH

Follow the [instructions here](https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/) to establish an SSH connection from your computer to your account on GitHub. SSH is a protocol that will ensure secure authentication into your account when you submit changes from your local machine.

## Basic Git Tutorial

The following tutorial will teach the basic Git commands, including how to create a repository, add and change files, and more: [Git Tutorial](http://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners)

---

## Basic Git Commands

Here are the basic steps you'll need to get started with a new repository on Git:

1. Tell Git who you are. You'll only have to do this once:
```
git config --global user.name "Sam Smith"
git config --global user.email sam@example.com
```

2. Create a new repository. It's easiest to do this on [Github.com](https://www.github.com/), following [these instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-new-repository/).

3. Clone the repository to your local machine
```
git clone /path/to/repository
```

4. Make some changes, adding or editing a file for instance.

5. View the status of the changes made. (You can check the status at any time)
```
git status
```

6. Add the changed files to Git staging area.
```
git add <filename>
```
or to add everything:
```
git add *
```

7. Commit the changes with a message:
```
git commit -m "Commit message"
```

8. Push the changes to GitHub:
```
git push origin master
```

## What is HTML?

Now that we know how to use version control to start a new project, let's talk about the core language of website content: HTML. **HTML** stands for **Hyper Text Markup Language**. It is a language that uses blocks called **tags** or **elements** to describe the structure of a website. HTML is the markup language that a browser like Google Chrome reads to determine what type of content and interactive elements are on the page.

A simple HTML document may look like something like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Web Page</title>
  </head>
  
  <body>
    <h1>My Heading</h1>
    <p>My first paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

As you can see, it consists of a series of opening tags (like `<p>`) and closing tags (`</p>`) that enclose content at different levels. This is what each of the tags mean in the example above:

- The `<!DOCTYPE html>` indicates to the browser that this is an HTML document.
- The `<html>` element encloses all the HTML on the page. This is also known as a **root element**.
- The `<head>` element contains "meta" data about the page that search engines use like a title and description.
- The `<title>` element specifies a title for the web page.
- The `<body>` element contains all of the content that is visible in the browser.
- The `<h1>` element defines the largest first level heading. There are also `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>`, `<h6>` for smaller headings. 
- The `<p>` element defines a paragraph.

---

## HTML Basics

### Metadata and the head tag

Every HTML document consists of a `head` and a `body`. The `head` element contains meta information that is not visible on the web page. Within the head, you will see the following:

- `<title>` specifies the title of the page that will show up on the web browser tab
- `<link>` links to external CSS files to style the page and JS to define interaction. We will learn about both in the class
- Metadata for search engines to find the website (such as description, keywords, etc)

Read more [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/The_head_metadata_in_HTML).

### Headings and Paragraphs

Most of the text content on a web page will either be a heading or a paragraph. Headings come at different levels in decreasing importance and size: `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h5>`, `<h5>`, and `<h6>` and paragraphs are defined with the `<p>` tag.

### Document Structure

HTML provides several tags to provide common structure to the document as a whole:

- `<header>` for header and `<footer>` for footer
- `<nav>` for the navigation bar
- `<main>` for main content, with various content subsections represented by `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<div>` elements.
- For a generalized block of content, use `<div>`. **Divs are one of the most commonly used tags in web development.** Whenever you have a section of content inside a rectangular container that needs to be styled, it's likely that a div is the way to go!
- `<span>` is like div but only for a specific segment of inline text.

### Lists

There are two types of lists in HTML: unordered (`<ul>`) and ordered (`<ol>`). The former gives you bulleted items; the latter gives you numbered items. List elements go inside the list tag as `<li>`, as follows:

```
<ol>
  My List:
  <li>First item</li>
  <li>Second item</li>
  <li>Third item</li>
</ol>
```

### Tables

HTML allows the creation of tables in the following format:

```
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Firstname</th>
    <th>Lastname</th> 
    <th>Age</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Jill</td>
    <td>Smith</td> 
    <td>50</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Eve</td>
    <td>Jackson</td> 
    <td>94</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

`<tr>` describes a row, `<th>` describes a cell within the header row, and `<td>` describes a cell within a body row.

### Images

To add an image to an HTML document, you must first have a reference to the image in the form of a URL where the image is stored on the web. Then you can use an `<img>` tag to and reference the image URL in the `src` attribute:

```
<img src="http://www.website.com/myimage.png" />
```

`img` tags are one of the tags in HTML that are *self-closing*, meaning that the `/` goes at the end of the opening tag instead of having a `</img>` tag to close it.

### Bold and Italicized Text

- For **bold** text, use the `<b>` tag.
- For *italicized* text, use the `<em>` tag.

### Forms

Forms generally involve `<form>`, `<input>`, `<select>` and `<button>` tags. We will dive deeper into how to create a form in this week's lab exercise. Here is a [good resource for how to structure a form](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms/How_to_structure_an_HTML_form).

## Creating a lab assignments repository

Now let's get into the lab assignment for this week. We will create a repository on GitHub for all the lab assignments for this class. 

1. Log in to [GitHub](https://www.github.com) and click *New Repository* under the menu bar.

2. Fill in the fields for your new repository and click **Create repository**. You can choose whichever name you'd like for the repository

3. Click the green Clone or Download button and copy the SSH address of the newly created repository.

4. Use this address to "clone" the repository to your computer. This will link up the project on GitHub with a folder on your local computer.

  1. Open up Terminal (Mac) or Git Bash (Windows)
  2. Use `cd` to navigate to a directory that you want the project to go under.
  3. Use `git clone` followed by the SSH address of your repository that you copied in the previous step.
  4. Now when you `ls` you should see a folder with your repository name. This is the copy of the Git repository on your computer.

## Branching

Branches on Git are a way to keep track of work that is separate from the main version of the project (that is on a special branch called `master`). We often use other branches for work in progress that is not yet ready to be finalized and published.

For lab assignments for the course, we will always start on a new branch, in order to have the capability to view changes for the individual assignments without having them lumped in with everything else on the main master branch. This will also allow instructors to comment on and review code in the form of a PR or [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).

To create a branch called `lab1`, type the following into a terminal while you are inside the folder for the git project:

```
git checkout -b lab1`
```

This will create the branch so that all code committed will go to the `lab1` branch.

To see all available branches, use:

```
git branch
```

and to switch to another branch, you can use:

```
git checkout [branch name]
```

## Download a text editor

If you don't already have a text editor for editing HTML, CSS and JS code on your computer, we recommend downloading either [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Atom](https://atom.io/). While we don't need it yet, since we are operating in the Codeacademy environment, it will soon be helpful for you to work on your own web development projects locally. Advanced text editors provide many useful features such as syntax highlighting and keyboard shortcuts that will make programming a lot easier!

## Lab Assignment

Your task is to produce a website for a student organization or club using HTML. The website should describe what the organization does, when the regular meeting times are, and list the student leaders. It can be based off of a real or imaginary student organization. Here's an example of what the it might look like:

![Lab 1](../images/01/lab1.png)

The requirements for the website's homepage HTML are that it must contain *at minimum*:

- A `title` (within the head tag) that shows up on the browser tab
- Headings and paragraphs
- A list (ordered or unordered)
- An image
- Bold and italicized font
- A link to another page to sign up for the mailing list (which we will create next)

Other than that, feel free to be creative and add whichever features or information students may find useful about your organization!

Your next challenge is to link the homepage to another page that contains a form where visitors can sign up for the organization's mailing list. You can reference [this page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms/How_to_structure_an_HTML_form) to learn the basics of HTML forms. It may also require some digging around on the internet to find how to produce these exact form inputs. Please use Google to find the answers you need! The form **does not** have to be functional, meaning it does not have to do anything when someone clicks submit (but all the elements should still be there).

The form should look like this, with two text fields for Name and Email, as well as a dropdown for Class Year:

![Lab 2](../images/01/lab2.png)

![Lab 3](../images/01/lab3.png)

Be sure that there is a link on the home page to reach the email signup page and there is another link from the email signup page back to the homepage.

Use the `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` to submit your code to the repository under your `lab1` branch. See [this tutorial](https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners) if you need a refresher on how to use Git.

Afterwards, make a pull request from your branch into `master` by following these `simple steps`. Submit a link to your pull request on Blackboard and an instructor will review your work.

Congratulations -- you're done with your first assignment!
